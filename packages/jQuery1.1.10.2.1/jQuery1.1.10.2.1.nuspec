    <description>JQuery has split into two versions. One that supports older browsers (1.x) and a new version that has dropped support (2+) does not support IE6/7/8.
      If you build websites and you use the JQuery NuGet package you have to remember to NOT update your JQuery. In addition other packages that have not been
      tested with verson 2 can use this package as a depedency instead of JQuery to prevent project update errors.
      
      Updating JQuery will update your package to version 2+ of JQuery. This package is JQuery1 and can be installed along with jQuery in the same project. 
      At the top of your View you would then include a directive for example like this.
      
      
          &lt;!--[if lt IE9]
              &lt;script src="jquery-1.10.2.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
          &lt;![endif]--&gt;
          &lt;!--[if gte IE 9]&lt;!--&gt;
              &lt;script src="jquery-2.0.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
          &lt;!--&lt;![endif]--&gt;
      
      
      According to JQuery there will be new versions of JQuery 1.x in the future.  This package will be updated to reflect that change and ease deployment.
      
      Updated in this minor update is better support for Project using SCC.  
      The Powershell script will now CHECK OUT the _references file
      if it isn't already checked out before modification.
      
      If you have JQuery 2 installed. This Package will use more a specific regex to
      modify the _references file to not remove JQuery 2 references and will correctly
      remove and add references for JQuery 1
